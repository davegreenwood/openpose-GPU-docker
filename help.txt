    -hand (Enables hand keypoint detection. It will share some parameters from

      `add_heatmaps_X` flag is enabled, it will place then in sequential memory
      order: body parts + bkg + PAFs. It will follow the order on
      POSE_BODY_PART_MAPPING in `src/openpose/pose/poseParameters.cpp`. Program
      speed will considerably decrease. Not required for OpenPose, enable it
      only if you intend to explicitly use this information later.) type: bool

    -heatmaps_scale (Set 0 to scale op::Datum::poseHeatMaps in the range

      with `resolution`); `3` to scale it in the range [0,1], where (0,0) would
      be the top-left corner of the image, and (1,1) the bottom-right one; and
      4 for range [-1,1], where (-1,-1) would be the top-left corner of the

      less accurate).) type: string default: "BODY_25"
    -net_resolution (Multiples of 16. If it is increased, the accuracy
      potentially increases. If it is decreased, the speed increases. For
      maximum speed-accuracy balance, it should keep the closest aspect ratio
      possible to the images or videos to be processed. Using `-1` in any of
      the dimensions, OP will choose the optimal aspect ratio depending on the
      user's input value. E.g. the default `-1x368` is equivalent to `656x368`
      in 16:9 resolutions, e.g. full HD (1980x1080) and HD (1280x720)
      resolutions.) type: string default: "-1x368"

    -number_people_max (This parameter will limit the maximum number of people
      detected, by keeping the people with top scores. The score is based in
      person area over the image, body part score, as well as joint score
      (between each pair of connected body parts). Useful if you know the exact
      number of people in the scene, so it can remove false positives (if all

      negatives by removing very small or highly occluded people. -1 will keep

    -part_candidates (Also enable `write_json` in order to save this
      information. If true, it will fill the op::Datum::poseCandidates array
      with the body part candidates. Candidates refer to all the detected body
      parts, before being assembled into people. Note that the number of
      candidates is equal or higher than the number of final body parts (i.e.
      after being assembled into people). The empty body parts are filled with
      0s. Program speed will slightly decrease. Not required for OpenPose,

      files, OpenPose will show some runtime statistics at this frame number.)
      type: int32 default: 1000
    -render_pose (Set to 0 for no rendering, 1 for CPU rendering (slightly
      faster), and 2 for GPU rendering (slower but greater functionality, e.g.
      `alpha_X` flags). If -1, it will pick CPU if CPU_ONLY is enabled, or GPU
      if CUDA is enabled. If rendering is enabled, it will render both
      `outputData` and `cvOutputData` with the original image and desired body
      part to be shown (i.e. keypoints, heat maps or PAFs).) type: int32
      default: -1
    -render_threshold (Only estimated keypoints whose score confidences are
      higher than this threshold will be rendered. Generally, a high threshold
      (> 0.5) will only render very clear body parts; while small thresholds
      (~0.1) will also output guessed and occluded keypoints, but also more
      false positives (i.e. wrong detections).) type: double
      default: 0.050000000000000003
    -scale_gap (Scale gap between scales. No effect unless scale_number > 1.
      Initial scale is always 1. If you want to change the initial scale, you
      actually want to multiply the `net_resolution` by your desired initial
      scale.) type: double default: 0.29999999999999999
    -scale_number (Number of scales to average.) type: int32 default: 1
    -tracking (Experimental, not available yet. Whether to enable people
      tracking across frames. The value indicates the number of frames where
